Overview
~~~~~~~~

A mod for BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy) and IWD:EE that introduces the new kit 
"Chaos Sorcerer" which can be seen as the Wild Mage counterpart for the Sorcerer class. For more 
details see the "Kit Description" section below.

The mod will also somewhat change the spell selection of Wild Mages. More information can be found 
in the "Components" section below.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive 
into your game directory and run "setup-A7-ChaosSorcerer.exe". Follow the instructions and you are 
ready to start.


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mod should be compatible with all other mods as long as they don't make substantial changes to 
Wild Magic spells.

The component "Revised Specialists" of "Tome and Blood" is known to interfere with the availability 
of the spell "Nahal's Reckless Dweomer".


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. "Chaos Sorcerer" kit (for BG:EE, BG2EE, EET and IWD:EE)

This component installs the Chaos Sorcerer kit with associated spells and HLAs. See Kit Description 
below for more details.

The component does also apply several changes to the Wild Mage spell selection:
1. New level 1 spell "Surge Control" applies a slim chance to avert the next Wild Surge.
2. New level 2 spell "Unluck" can be seen as the negative counterpart of the "Luck" spell.
3. "Chaos Shield" merges with "Improved Chaos Shield" and becomes a level 3 spell that starts 
   with a +15 wild surge bonus and improves to +20 and +25 at higher levels.
4. New level 7 spell "Nahal's Wildstrike" surrounds the target with an aura of chaotic energies. 
   Each time the target casts a spell will trigger a wild surge with unpredictable results.

The Wild Mage additions are also available to the Chaos Sorcerer. However, "Nahal's Reckless 
Dweomer" is replaced by "Chaotic Weave".


2. Recreate spell selection lists (requires main component)

This component can be used to recreate the spell selection lists used by "Chaotic Weave", as there 
is some randomness involved about which spells are included or not.
It can be safely called even in an ongoing game. It can also be used to update the spell selection 
lists if other mods, installed later, added new spells.


3. Make "Wild Mage" kit unavailable for character creation (requires main component)

Added by request, this component removes the Wild Mage kit from the list of available Mage kits 
during Character Generation, so that the Chaos Sorcerer remains as the only viable choice for a 
Wild Magic user.


Kit Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CHAOS SORCERER: Unlike Wild Mages, who struggle to comprehend the chaotic magic of damaged and 
distorted parts of the Weave, Chaos Sorcerers learned to derive their power from the Elemental 
Chaos itself – a plane that is largely unknown to most inhabitants of Toril.

The Elemental Chaos is a place of primeval entropy and discord, and not even the most seasoned 
practitioners can account for the inherent unpredictability of such forces. As a result chaos 
sorcerers have to rely on their agility and strong reflexes to slip out of the way of their own, 
often unpredictable, spells. Being exposed to this particular type of magic gradually increases 
the caster's resistance to all forms or magical energy. A basic understanding of the nature of 
Chaos is required to walk this most dangerous of paths.

Advantages:
– May cast the 1st-level spells Chaotic Weave and Surge Control (automatically added to spell list).
– May cast the 2nd-level spell Unluck (automatically added to spell list).
– May cast the 3rd-level spell Chaos Shield (automatically added to spell list).
– May cast the 5th-level spell Conjure Chaos Elemental (automatically added to spell list).
– May cast the 7th-level spell Nahal's Wildstrike (automatically added to spell list).
– Casting level varies slightly whenever he/she casts a spell—anywhere between five levels lower 
  and five levels higher than the Chaos Sorcerer's true level.
– 1st level: +1 bonus to Saves vs. Spell.
– 5th level: +1 bonus to Dexterity.
– 6th level: +1 bonus to Saves vs. Spell.
– 8th level: +5% Magic Resistance.
– 11th level: +1 bonus to Saves vs. Spell.
– 15th level: +1 bonus to Dexterity.
– 16th level: +1 bonus to Saves vs. Spell.
– 16th level: +5% Magic Resistance.
– 21st level: +1 bonus to Saves vs. Spell.
– 24th level: +5% Magic Resistance.

Disadvantages:
– Incurs a -2 penalty to Strength and Constitution.
– Alignment restricted to chaotic good, chaotic neutral and chaotic evil.
– May cast fewer spells per level per day.
– Upon casting a spell, there is a 5% chance of incurring a wild surge.

WILD SURGE: A wild surge generates a completely random magical effect from the spell being cast. 
Its effects may be either beneficial or detrimental to the Chaos Sorcerer and his/her allies.
